**ServiceMesh-Mapper** is a Python 3 tool designed to simulate inter-microservice calls, build a directed dependency graph, and visually map microservices communication flows with latency insights. It‚Äôs built for DevOps/SRE teams who want a quick visualization of service dependencies and communication patterns.

## üåê Architecture

Flow:  
1. Load `service_calls.json` containing simulated call events (caller, callee, latency)  
2. Build directed graph among services, accumulate call counts & latencies  
3. Generate `service_map_report.json` summarizing nodes & edges with metrics  
4. Draw the graph and save as `service_map.png` for visual inspection  
5. Use the report and graph for dashboards, CI/CD checks, architecture reviews
